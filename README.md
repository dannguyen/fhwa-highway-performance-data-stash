# Scraping and Compiling the FHWA's Highway Performance Monitoring System Geospatial Data


The NYT just published this cool mapping interactive, [The Most Detailed Map of
Auto Emissions in America](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/10/climate/driving-emissions-map.html). It was based on data from a 2015 Boston University/NOAA study, [Cities, traffic, and CO2: A multidecadal assessment of trends, drivers, and scaling relationships](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/16/4999):

(emphasis added)

> To unravel the joint spatial and temporal covariation between multiple predictors and emissions, we constructed a new, dynamic, process-based emissions inventory. The Database of Road Transportation Emissions (DARTE) is an annual 1-km resolution CO2 emissions inventory for the US on-road transportation sector, based on archived data of roadway-level vehicle traffic for the years 1980–2012. **Raw vehicle activity data were obtained from the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA’s) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS)**, a database of road-level traffic counts derived from annual reporting by all US state transportation departments

The [footnote for this reference](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/16/4999#ref-32) doesn't link to an online resource, but the FHWA has a page with zipped geospatial for each state from 2011 to 2017:
